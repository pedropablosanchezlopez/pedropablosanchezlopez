I am a passionate of the tech world, although I'm just starting my career as a software engineer I believe in  creating technology to elevate people, and building community and learn new techonologies to solve problems of nowdays.
Some of the technologies that I have had the pleasure to learn are:
:yellow_circle: Javascript 
:large_blue_circle: React
:orange_circle: HTML
:purple_circle: CSS
:white_circle: SQL
:snake: Python

I really wish to get into a new role to keep expanding the opportunities that the tech world gives to contribute in the continuous improvement of resolution of problems.

See you around!
